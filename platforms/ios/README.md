This is a simple iOS signature view and controller to capture a PNG image from a finger drawn signature. It is based on Apple Inc's example code.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------

You must add the OpenGLES.framework and QuartzCore.framework to the Xcode project. Implement this repository as git sub module to your iOS project.

Look at https://github.com/jcmontiel/SignatureViewExample.git for an example of how to implement.

EXAMPLE
-------

Here is an example of how to implement the SignatureViewController and it's signature view into your own viewControllers.

self.signature is a UIView reference to an IBOutlet (from xib), that is the placeholder for the signature view

self.signatureViewController will be instantiated in your viewDidLoad to control the signatureView, then the signatureViewController.view replaces the self.signature view and is put under control of your viewController.

	//
	- (void)viewDidLoad
	{
		[super viewDidLoad];
  
		self.signatureController = [[[SignatureViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SignatureView" bundle:nil] autorelease];
		self.signatureController.delegate = self;
  
		self.signatureController.view.frame = self.signatureView.frame;
		[self.view insertSubview:self.signatureController.view belowSubview:self.signatureView];
		[self.signatureView removeFromSuperview];
		self.signatureView = self.signatureController.view;
	}


	- (void) signatureViewController:(SignatureViewController *)viewController didSign:(NSData *)signature;
	{
		NSData *thisSignature = signature;
		// 
		// Do something with thisSignature, like save it to a file or a database as binary data.
		//
	}
